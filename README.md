# Dimension Network
Decentralized Application Service Network    

[Official Website](http://dimensionchain.io/)


# Project Brief  

DIMENSION is dedicated to building a new generation of decentralized blockchain application service networks. The underlying functions, such as general account and smart contract, solve the digital asset confirmation and programmable control, and ensure the security and transparency of transactions. Based on the technical scheme of data privacy protection and cross-chain interconnection, cross-chain consensus coexistence can be realized, DApp can be operated on the main chain, and data interconnection and sharing between main chains can be finally realized.

DIMENSION continuously explores and practices blockchain innovation technology. DIMENSION has evolved into a middleware application framework of data interconnection and sharing among multiple chains in the second stage. DIMENSION-G (DIMENSION FOR GAME), which focuses on the pan-entertainment field in the first stage, has been running stable as the side chain of the project. This side chain not only covers games, but also includes IP, video, novels, etc. Platform users can obtain token rewards through content creation. Users can re-create the authorized IP and automatically share it with the creator and the original IP owner through the smart contract. Thus, it protects the interests of players, CP, channels and other parties, and realizes the ecological win-win situation in the field of decentralized pan-entertainment. Subsequently, DIMENSION FOR EOS/ADA/ETH and other multi-chain internet networks will be launched successively.
  
DIMENSION can realize cross-chain interconnection through the adaptive framework. It adopts a number of privacy encryption technologies, such as fully homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing, verifiable algorithm, zero-knowledge proof, etc., to achieve data sharing and transaction on the blockchain, and maximize DIMENSION as the core value of the service network. Combined with decentralized community governance, it provides an efficient and convenient blockchain service network for commercial applications from multiple technical dimensions.

# Dimension-E Aiming

Dimension-E solves the problem of data monopoly in the gaming industry by using the three-tier structure system: universal account system, virtual asset trading system and virtual asset monetization system. It ensures the security and transparency of transactions and solves game companyâ€™s problem of lack of new business models, provides additional values to the virtual assets and helps developers, content providers, distributors, players, and other related parties reach a win-win situation.

The game account system is the most basic service for players when entering the platform. The universal account system will use the game SDK to store game data on the blockchain. Players can anchor the universal account system to save their information, which ensures the system security and improves account privacy. A player's account now becomes privately owned instead of owned by any organization. On the one hand, this system reduces the cost of experience different game; on the other hand, the player can bind any virtual gaming assets with the distributed platform through the universal account.  By holding the private key and certificate, players can conveniently manage or transfer their assets to the exchange or the platform.

Dimension-E coordinates with multiple gaming companies to build an external virtual trading platform, and players can open shops on it to sell virtual assets. The platform will satisfy players' demand for game equipment and asset, without excessive interference to the original in-game economy system, and use smart contracts to transfer different assets among different games. The transaction records are transparent,  immutable and easy to check. The platform will greatly improve players' gaming experience, protect their interests, and gradually establish an universal game economy.

With the continuous growth of the ecosystem, the platform will enter the third phase of development, namely the monetization of virtual assets. By joining the Dimension-E platform, whether it is in the game industry or others, companies can issue tokens on the platform to monetize their digital assets such as reward points or intellectual properties. 

Dimension-E is suitable for business that requires virtual assets, such as industries with loyalty programs, tickets, digital games, animations, or many others.
