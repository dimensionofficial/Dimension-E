# Dimension Network
Decentralized Application Service Network    

[Official Website](http://dimensionchain.io/)


# PROJECT BRIEF  

DIMENSION is dedicated to building a new generation of decentralized blockchain application service networks. The underlying functions, such as general account and smart contract, solve the digital asset confirmation and programmable control, and ensure the security and transparency of transactions. Based on the technical scheme of data privacy protection and cross-chain interconnection, cross-chain consensus coexistence can be realized, DApp can be operated on the main chain, and data interconnection and sharing between main chains can be finally realized.

DIMENSION continuously explores and practices blockchain innovation technology. DIMENSION has evolved into a middleware application framework of data interconnection and sharing among multiple chains in the second stage. DIMENSION-G (DIMENSION FOR GAME), which focuses on the pan-entertainment field in the first stage, has been running stable as the side chain of the project. This side chain not only covers games, but also includes IP, video, novels, etc. Platform users can obtain token rewards through content creation. Users can re-create the authorized IP and automatically share it with the creator and the original IP owner through the smart contract. Thus, it protects the interests of players, CP, channels and other parties, and realizes the ecological win-win situation in the field of decentralized pan-entertainment. Subsequently, DIMENSION FOR EOS/ADA/ETH and other multi-chain internet networks will be launched successively.
  
DIMENSION can realize cross-chain interconnection through the adaptive framework. It adopts a number of privacy encryption technologies, such as fully homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing, verifiable algorithm, zero-knowledge proof, etc., to achieve data sharing and transaction on the blockchain, and maximize DIMENSION as the core value of the service network. Combined with decentralized community governance, it provides an efficient and convenient blockchain service network for commercial applications from multiple technical dimensions.
